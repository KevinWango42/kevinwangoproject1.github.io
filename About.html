                        <h1>ABOUT THE WU-TANG</h1>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Wu-Tang Clan is an American hip hop 
                        group formed in Staten Island, New York City, in 1992. Its original
                        members include RZA, GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Method Man, Raekwon, 
                        Ghostface Killah, Inspectah Deck, U-God, and Masta Killa. Close 
                        affiliate Cappadonna later became an official member. Wu-Tang Clan 
                        are regarded as a highly influential group in hip hop, helping to
                        popularize and develop the East Coast hip hop and hardcore hip
                        hop styles. They are often referred to as the greatest hip hop group of all time.

                        <span class="description"><p style="text-align:justify;">As a hip hop beat-maker, de facto leader of Wu-Tang and 
                            musician, RZA rivals Dr. Dre and DJ Premier as one of the greatest producers in hip hop history. Arguably 
                            the most brazen and aggressive on Wu-Tang’s debut, RZA made his presence felt despite taking a backseat 
                            to other members like GZA, Method Man and Ol’ Dirty Bastard.</p></span>

                        <span class="description"><p style="text-align:justify;">As the eldest and most experienced rapper in the Wu, 
                            the GZA is an efficient master of linguistics, opting for a simpler, more straight forward approach to 
                            lyricism than his brothers, but achieving the same mind bending result. His intricately crafted rhymes have
                             won him love and acclaim from hip-hop heads and rappers alike.</p></span>

                        <span class="description"><p style="text-align:justify;">Meth’s melodic flow and raspy voice would probably push
                            him to the top. His sing-a-long lyrical style coupled with astonishing wordplay abilities and hilarious personality 
                            make him one of the most charismatic rappers of all time.  Meth has consistently stolen the spotlight on the group 
                            albums and shown why he’s one of the best rappers in the Wu-Tang Clan.</p></span>

                            his watertight delivery makes him one of rap’s finest lyricists. Deck’s perfected all traits of a great rapper; having

                    <span class="description"><p style="text-align:justify;">Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s real-life antics never overshadowed his 
                        on-record abilities. His prowess on the mic was unprecedented at its time and is still unmatched to this day with 
                        bizarre one-liners, nasty subject matters and a warped lyrical style defining his technique. Ol’ Dirty was a true 
                        character and will forever be remembered as the heart, soul and craziest member of the Wu-Tang Clan.</p></span>

                        is critically acclaimed for his loud, fast-paced flow, and his emotional "stream of consciousness" narratives 
                        containing cryptic slang and non-sequiturs. Ghostface has unparalleled storytelling instincts; he might be the best,
                        most colorful storyteller rap has ever seen.</p></span>

                        those who favour his slow, deliberate flow and thoughtfully written rhymes. Strictly devoted to his craft, the enigmatic rapper 
                        has shunned the spotlight, remaining in the shadows only to show up now and then to devastate your eardrums.</p></span>

                    <span class="description"><p style="text-align:justify;">Also known as Raekwon The Chef, Chef’s uncompromising brand of hip-hop, his 
                        taste for indecipherable slang and murky crime stories has kept him from hitting those commercial peaks, there’s no doubt that Rae 
                        is amongst the greatest rappers of all time and absolutely one of the best rappers in the Wu-Tang Clan.</p></span>

                    <span class="description"><p style="text-align:justify;">U-God's rugged baritone is tailor-made for hard boom bap-styled beats and when 
                        he rhymes its pure street poetry. He never ceases to fail on the group albums, and at times, shone brightly against the likes of Raekwon 
                        and Ghostface. Hard as hell but deeply poetic at the same time, U-God is a true street rapper and one of the always-reliable backbones of 
                        the Wu-Tang Clan.</p></span>

                        the years. While long referred to by both the group and fans as the "Unofficial Tenth Member". Though he was the last to join as an offical 
                        member of the Wu-Tang Clan, Staten Island rapper Cappadonna (also known as Cappachino) was affiliated with the supergroup from their beginning.
